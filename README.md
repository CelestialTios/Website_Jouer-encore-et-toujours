# About this project

This project is a website made in HTML and CSS during my first academic year. This project has for goal to make us discover the universe of web programming and the management of a project with customer constraints. It was made in 3 months, in addition to our courses.

To achieve this project, we only had to complete 5 pages of the site. We also had to create a report to justify our choices such as graphics, ergonomics, features or accessibility for example. In this document were also mentionned the other pages of the site that we imagined in addition of the one created.

## About the association "Jouer, encore et toujours"

It is a fictious association of board games who played the role of customer in this project. They wanted a website that would make people want to take an interest in their association and go there to meet others and play together. The website had to shows what they do such as the projects in which they are involved or the events they organize for example. A part of their needs were mentionned in a statement of work but we also had to think of needs that they didn't mentionned to create a unique and fonctional site that reflect the activity of the association.
